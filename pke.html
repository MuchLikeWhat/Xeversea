<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Partai Keadilan Evernesia (PKE)</strong> is a student-led political party formed within
the <b>Republic of Evernesia</b>. The party emerged from concerns regarding governance clarity,
accountability, and protection of student rights under the existing sector administration system.
</p>

<p>
PKE positions itself as a <em>reformist</em> rather than revolutionary movement. Its objective is to
address institutional loopholes through structured reform, deliberation, and consensus, while
maintaining class stability.
</p>

<p>
Historically, PKE’s approach resembles moderate reform movements such as constitutional reform blocs
in Meiji-era Japan or Indonesia’s post-1998 reform period, where legitimacy and gradual institutional
change were prioritized over abrupt power shifts.
</p>

<h2>Political Position</h2>
<p>
PKE occupies a centrist and stabilizing position within class politics. The party rejects unchecked
authority and arbitrary enforcement, while also distancing itself from ideological extremes that lack
practical governance mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
The party supports the establishment of a <strong>Republic</strong> model for Evernesia, emphasizing
checks and balances, transparency, and civic safeguards.
</p>

<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<p>
PKE’s platform focuses on identifying foundational governance gaps rather than prescribing rigid
or overly detailed solutions. The party’s core principles include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anti-Pembungkaman (Anti-Silencing):</strong> Protection of freedom of opinion, except in
  cases where content is proven to involve SARA or explicit material.</li>

  <li><strong>Anti-Abuse of Power:</strong> Prohibition of misuse of authority by any class official.</li>

  <li><strong>Financial Transparency:</strong> Clear and regular disclosure of class financial
  management.</li>

  <li><strong>Limits of Authority:</strong> Defined boundaries for each class office to prevent
  overreach.</li>

  <li><strong>Evaluation of Officials:</strong> Periodic performance assessment of class officials.</li>

  <li><strong>Protection of Citizens:</strong> Safeguards for people of Evernesia against arbitrary
  punishment or unfair treatment.</li>

  <li><strong>Seat Movement Regulation:</strong> Permission-based seat changes with approval from
  the current teaching staff.</li>

  <li><strong>Supervisory Piket Duty:</strong> Responsibility of top-ranked piket members to supervise
  post-class cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These principles are intentionally framed as a <strong>constitutional framework</strong>, not a
finalized constitution, leaving room for deliberation and preventing premature consolidation of
power.
</p>

<h2>Organizational Stance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Non-confrontational:</strong> Emphasizes dialogue and formal discussion over conflict.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimacy-first:</strong> Seeks reform through recognized procedures and collective
  agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy-before-power:</strong> Prioritizes identifying systemic issues before proposing
  enforcement mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship to Governance</h2>
<p>
PKE maintains constructive engagement with class leadership while preserving its independence.
The party views oversight and critique as essential components of healthy governance rather than
acts of opposition.
</p>

<h2>View on Party System</h2>
<p>
PKE supports a plural, discussion-based party system within Sector XE. According to the party,
organized political groups help channel grievances into policy debate, reduce personalization of
power, and normalize accountability as a civic responsibility.
</p>

<h2>Criticism and Response</h2>
<p>
Critics have described PKE as overly cautious or insufficiently ideological. In response, the party
argues that durable reform requires legitimacy, operational feasibility, and collective support,
rather than rapid but unstable change.
</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>
PKE has met the membership threshold to operate as a formal political party within Sector XE. The
party continues to prepare reform agendas and discussion documents for future class deliberations,
maintaining its role as a stabilizing reformist force within the Republic of Evernesia.
